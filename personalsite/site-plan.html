				Welcome to Meg's Lil Soul Pacthe's website! This is a relatively new brand, so this will be a growing project! I hope you all will join me in this learning process and enjoy what I have to offer!
				If you'd like to understand a little bit about how Meg's Lil Soul Patches came to be, here is a little about me and my journey to discovering one of my passions! 
				
				The Journey of Self-discovery

				Self-discovery is not an easy task. It can be lonely and can lead to a lot of self-doubting. Although challenging, self-discovery is such an important thing to do. I encourage it for everyone since it leads to a happier sense of self and a happier lifestyle in the end. I will warn that like therapy and most things good for us, things will get worse before they get better as you go through a self-discovery process. To understand my journey, it’s essential to know my foundation. Growing up, family and helping others defined my sense of self-worth. My value came from what I could do for my loved ones. While loving and building relationships is undoubtedly positive, basing my entire self-worth on these connections was not healthy. At the time, I didn’t realize this; it was simply what I knew, and I was comfortable with it.

				Marriage
				Then I got married. I adore my husband and our relationship, but the early days of marriage required significant adjustments. I’ve always been a peacemaker, willing to adapt myself for the happiness of others. My empathy, a quality I still treasure, often led me to live for others rather than myself. When my husband and I started living together, this habit caused tension.
				I deeply admire my husband’s strong sense of self, but his independence highlighted my own lack of it. I found myself either going along with all his decisions without question or struggling to voice my own thoughts and desires. Confronting what I wanted—truly wanted—was deeply uncomfortable. The more I questioned myself, the more lost and unhappy I felt. I feel for my husband, who had to witness my inner turmoil. My confusion caused disagreements, but his understanding and encouragement were vital to my growth.  He recognized my upbringing and supported me as I began to define myself outside of familial expectations. Although there were still times of confrontation and confusion, it slowly became less, and we became happier. This still can be challenging since the comfort of just going along and being a peacemaker is still very much a part of me. I must choose every day to be more assertive and to be proud of who I am. 
				I learned something very important. In marriage it is important to know that you don’t have to want the same things to be happily married. In fact, it is important for a marriage to have two different people who want different things. This was not something I thought was normal, but now I am so grateful for my husband’s and my differences, and I wouldn’t want us to be more similar. 

				A Different Type of Self-Discovery 
					At that point in time, I had finally gotten to a more independent form of self within my marriage, it was then time to understand myself better within my daily life and how I wanted to spend my time. I wasn’t entirely happy with my first choice of going to college to learn psychology, but I blame that mainly on the fact that my time at college in the beginning was during Covid-19. Life was far different than normal to determine whether or not my education in psychology was the problem or if it was the pandemic and how it determined the way schools were continuing education during it. So, I changed, I decided to go to hair school. 



				Something I Wish I Could Have Skipped, But Needed (Hair School) 
				At the time, hair school was an exciting change that both my husband and I felt would be good for me. Sadly, in self-discovery, there are mistakes made, and we get to know what is not right as we try to find what is right for ourselves. Hair school was probably one of the most challenging and miserable times of my life. Unfortunately, I couldn’t change this choice due to how finances work within this particular hair school. I was stuck and had to complete school, unless if I was willing to lose $15,000 for nothing. Which both my husband and I were too stubborn to do. 
				Although miserable, I learned a lot. I stopped being as much of a pushover since there were so many people at the school that would take advantage of me if they had the chance. I learned to stand up for myself more than ever and still be kind to those who deserved it. I learned some great skills that I continue to use to this day, and I was able to graduate and earn my license. I was just so happy to be done and hoped for a happier path to be ahead of me. 



				Choosing Another Path 
					I tried to work with my new skills, but I was still unhappy, and eventually, my husband and I agreed it was time for another change. This was extremely hard because it felt like a waste of money, time, tears, and more. How could I just go back to school and leave behind cosmetology? I struggled for a long time with this, but eventually realized that I didn’t want to waste more happiness and time on something I knew wasn’t right for me. So, I went back to college. 
				I began to try psychology again now that the pandemic passed. I realized that I love psychology as something to learn about, but I didn’t want to do it for a career. I then tried child development, I discovered the same thing for this topic, and I realized that it was also a way for me to yearn for the comfort of going back to what I knew before my self-discovery journey. I wanted to start a family and lose myself in the service of them and value myself for what I did for others. I was still determined to find something I loved just for myself though. 

				Finally!
				So, I started graphic design at college and my life began to change in ways I had never seen or felt before. I found a love for graphic design and am continuing to search this newfound passion. I have expanded on this love and am now in web development and design. I am still on my journey of self-discovery, but I have finally found something that I consider my own and no one else’s. Each thing I learn and grow in to create things in graphic design feels freeing. Still challenging at times, but I am understanding myself more and becoming happier with myself. Here are some of my creations that have helped me really get to know myself: 
				My Very First Creation on Procreate 
				
				This Creation Was One That Proved to Me I Was Getting Better at What I Was Doing 

				Soon, I feel that I will be able to enjoy starting a family, while keeping my own identity. I can imagine a future where I continue using my graphic design skills while sitting at home with my kids. It won’t stop me from still enjoying my future family, but it will also allow me to have a role along with being a mother and wife. Something that helped fuel my continuation of my journey of self-discovery was seeing what happened to my mom and my mother-in-law once they became empty nesters. They felt empty now that they didn’t have kids to take care of. They spent so long constantly being mom that they forgot who they were themselves. They are currently trying to rediscover what brings them joy outside of being mothers and it is challenging. I am grateful that I have started this part of my journey to try and help me not run into that hard realization when I eventually become an empty nester.  This is comforting and brings me joy. 
				I share all of this to encourage you to find your own joy. Don’t get stuck in what feels comfortable but doesn’t bring you happiness. Try and get used to feeling uncomfortable because it will make you happier in the long run. Everyone deserves to discover themselves, please allow yourself the chance to.]
